# Movie Information Client

A standalone desktop client that allows the user to search for movies and TV shows to find additional information about them or to add them to their wishlist. 

## Installation

This project was developed using Visual Studio, so that is the easiest way to view the software. The latest release is available to download [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).

However, you are able to compile the C# files yourself if you wish. 

## Usage

The application uses a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Therfore, you can use the buttons and text boxes to interact with the system.
